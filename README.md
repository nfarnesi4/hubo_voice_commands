# Hubo Voice Commands
This is a small tool that uses cmu sphixbase, a light weight and open source voice recognition toolkit, to listen to voice commands on the Hubo humanoid robot at Drexel university. The voice commands run the bash commands specified in the config file on the robot.

The tool requires the following programs to be installed in order to build correctly:

- Pocketsphinx 5PreAlpha
- sphnixbase 5PreAlpha
- python2
- gstream0.10-base
- gst-plugins-base-libs
- libpulse
- libsamplerate
